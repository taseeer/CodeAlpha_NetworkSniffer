# CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1 Submission

## Student Information
- **Name:** Taseer Ullah
- **Internship Domain:** Cyber Security
- **Task Completed:** Task 1 - Basic Network Sniffer
- **Submission Date:** February 1, 2026

## Project Overview
Successfully developed a Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic. The project includes both basic and advanced versions with detailed packet analysis.

## Files Submitted
1. `sniffer.py` - Basic network sniffer (10 packet limit)
2. `advanced_sniffer.py` - Enhanced sniffer with detailed analysis
3. `test_sniffer.py` - Dependency verification script
4. `requirements.txt` - Required packages
5. `README.md` - Complete project documentation

## Features Implemented
✅ Captures network traffic packets using Scapy library
✅ Analyzes packet structure and content (IP, TCP, UDP layers)
✅ Displays source/destination IPs, protocols, and payloads
✅ Identifies common services (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.)
✅ Shows MAC addresses and TCP flags
✅ Safe operation with packet count limits
✅ Works in isolated virtual environment

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding network packet structure and protocols
- Implementing packet capture in Python
- Analyzing different network layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP)
- Identifying security-relevant information in packets
- Safe ethical hacking practices
