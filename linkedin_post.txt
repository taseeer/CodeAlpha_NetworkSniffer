Excited to share my first project completion for the CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship! 🚀

✅ Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer

I've developed a Python-based network packet analyzer that:
• Captures and analyzes network traffic packets
• Identifies protocols (TCP/UDP), IP addresses, and ports
• Displays MAC addresses and service information
• Implements safe packet capture with limits

This project helped me understand:
🔹 Network packet structure and protocol layers
🔹 Real-time traffic analysis techniques
🔹 Ethical hacking fundamentals
🔹 Python networking with Scapy library
